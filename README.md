# Face Recognition-Based Attendance System  
This project implements a **Face Recognition-Based Attendance System** using Python and various machine learning libraries. It automates the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces in real-time or through pre-recorded images or videos. The system is efficient, secure, and user-friendly, making it ideal for schools, colleges, offices, and other organizations.  

## Features  
- **Face Detection and Recognition**:  
  Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and recognize faces with high accuracy.  
- **Real-Time Attendance**:  
  Capture faces in real-time using a webcam or camera feed to mark attendance.  
- **Image and Video Support**:  
  Allows attendance marking from pre-captured images or video files.  
- **Database Management**:  
  Stores attendance records securely in a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).  
- **Interactive GUI**:  
  Includes a simple and interactive interface for administrators and users.  
- **Notification System**:  
  Sends notifications (e.g., email) for attendance reports or irregularities.  
- **Scalability**:  
  Can handle multiple users efficiently with the ability to update face records dynamically.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Tools**:  
  - OpenCV: For face detection and processing  
  - dlib: For facial feature extraction  
  - face-recognition: For identifying registered users  
  - Pandas: For data handling and analysis  
  - Numpy: For numerical operations  
  - Tkinter or PyQt: For GUI development (optional)  
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL for storing user and attendance data  

## How It Works  
1. **Register Faces**:  
   Register a user's face and save their information in the database.  
2. **Capture Input**:  
   Capture input via webcam, video, or image files.  
3. **Face Matching**:  
   Compare detected faces with registered faces using the face-recognition library.  
4. **Mark Attendance**:  
   Record the recognized user's attendance in the database with a timestamp.  
5. **Generate Reports**:  
   Generate and export attendance reports in CSV or Excel formats.  

## Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the project:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git  
   cd face-recognition-attendance  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Run the application:
